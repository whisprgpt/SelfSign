    ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: In the [YouTube Installation Video](https://youtu.be/t2cnGZuFLbg?si=cMzt-At5l-LWNan7) I typed my password inside the terminal, YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DO THAT HERE
    
    ```bash
    ./self_sign.sh
    ```
    
    ### üîß Troubleshooting  
      If you see an error like this after running:  
      
      > codesign.key: Permission denied
      
      OR *macOS* still says the app is damaged, rerun the script with **sudo** and click **Enter**:  
      ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: In this case, you **will need to enter your Mac password**.  
      ‚ÑπÔ∏è When typing your password, **nothing will appear on screen** (no dots or characters) ‚Äî this is normal macOS security behavior.  
   
      ```bash
      sudo ./self_sign.sh
      ```
